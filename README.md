# Sample Workspace

Simply put, this is a workspace to help you get started with modding for Across the Obelisk. Not much else to it. If you have questions, feel free to ping me or DM me on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/679706811108163701/1036707612978319510).

Below I have reproduced the beginner's guide to modding for AtO (the Discord version is likely more up-to-date).
