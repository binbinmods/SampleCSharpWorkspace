# <ModName>

A hero mod, introducing Ulfvitr, a Shaman imprisoned by Gorio. 

Thanks to:

This mod relies on [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/).



## Installation (manual)

1. Install [Obeliskial Essentials](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Essentials/) and [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/).
2. Click _Manual Download_ at the top of the page.
3. In Steam, right-click Across the Obelisk and select _Manage_->_Browse local files_.
4. Extract the archive into the game folder. Your _Across the Obelisk_ folder should now contain a _BepInEx_ folder and a _doorstop\_libs_ folder.
5. Run the game. If everything runs correctly, you will see this mod in the list of registered mods on the main menu.
6. Press F5 to open/close the Config Manager and F1 to show/hide mod version information.
7. Note: I am not certain about these install instructions. In the worst case, just copy _TheWiseWolf.dll_ into the _BepInEx\plugins_ folder, and the _Ulfvitr_ folder (the one with the subfolders containing the json files) into _BepInEx\config\Obeliskial\_importing_

## Installation (automatic)

1. Download and install [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
